# FLEXBOX

_from my internship: everything is a box, containing more boxes, you control which direction the boxes go and how they react to changes to viewing widths_

- flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows or columns
- flexbox is a recent addition to CSS, included to address common layout frustrations
- flexbox allows us to distribute space dynamically across elements of an unknown size, hence the term "flex"

## flex-direction

- To use it, you have to type "display: flex;" into a CSS selector.
- In a flex container, we have to know that there are two main axes, the main axis and the cross axis.
- the "flex-direction" property allows us to choose our main axis direction in our container.
  - it defaults to "flex-direction: row;" (left-right)
  - row-reverse - flips the row (right-left)
  - column - top to bottom
  - column-reverse - bottom to top.

## justify-content
