## Entity Code
- Special sequences that we can use inside of our HTML that will result in different characters. 
  - These could be reserved characters, or things that are difficult to type (i.e. the copyright character)
- Start with an ampersand and end with a semicolon
- the browser interprets them and renders the correct character instead.
