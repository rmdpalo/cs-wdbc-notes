# Semantic Elements & HTML Extras
## What is HTML 5
- Living Standard 
  - The HTML standard is a document that describes how HTML should work
- Role of Browsers
  - The standard describes the rules of HTML, but browsers actually have to do the work and implement HTML according to those rules.
- HTML 5
  - the latest evolution of the standard that defines HTML. It includes new elements & features for browsers to implement.

## Entity Code
- Special sequences that we can use inside of our HTML that will result in different characters. 
  - These could be reserved characters, or things that are difficult to type (i.e. the copyright character)
- Start with an ampersand and end with a semicolon
- the browser interprets them and renders the correct character instead.

## Semantic Markup
relating to meaning, semantic markup is __meaningful markup__
- header, nav, main, footer, section, etc. all act like divs but are more meaningful and give us an idea of what its purpose is.
- why?
  - SEO: Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings. (-MDN)
  - Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page.
  - finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless divs with or without semantic or namespaced classes
  - suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated
  - semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming (like in React)
